# California-housing-dataset
California housing dataset which is about priceing analysis and prediction 
## Conclusion 
### Housing Median Age:
- **Dominant Age Range**: The majority of housing units fall within the '21-40' age range, indicating a substantial concentration in this bracket.
- **Limited Older Housing**: Fewer units have a median age > 60, suggesting the primary range spans from 0 to 60.
- **Average Median Housing Age**: The dataset's average median housing age is 28.

### Housing Median Age Distribution:
- **Low Percentage in Some Ranges**: The '50-60' age group has notably low representation, with '0-10' comprising only 7.5% of the dataset.

### Relationship Between Median House Value and Median Income:
- **Direct Proportionality**: An increase in median house value is directly proportional to median income, indicating a positive correlation.

### Handling Missing Data:
- **Data Rows Removed**: 207 rows were removed due to missing 'total_bedrooms' values, ensuring data completeness.

### Latitude and Longitude Analysis:
- **Inverse Relationship**: Latitude vs. longitude plot suggests a negative correlation, indicating an inverse relationship between them.
- **Geographical Variations**: 'Near ocean' locations exhibit lower latitude and longitude compared to 'inland' areas.

### Median Income and Median House Value in Coastal Areas:
- **Discrepancy in Mean and Median Income**: Near the ocean, mean income is around 4.006, slightly higher than the median income of 3.647, hinting at potential income disparities or skewed distributions.

### Total Bedroom Size Categorization:
- **Medium Bedroom Sizes**: Majority of total bedrooms fall under the 'medium' category, suggesting commonality in bedroom size within the dataset.

These insights offer an understanding of housing demographics, geographical distributions, income trends, and data handling within the dataset.
